<ins>App Description</ins>
Bus drivers are travelling either route 1 or 2. 
They would use the app:
1) To gauge how far is the bus ahead
2) Interact with map for information â€” Other buses, Bus Stops along the same route
3) App would repeatedly insert location in the backend while bus is moving 
    for other bus drivers to view.

<ins>General Flow</ins>
When app is started, at the Homescreen:
1) App will start scanning for beacons and identify the closest few beacons for user to select. 
(Identify your own bus instance)
2) If more than 1 beacon detected, show the detected few. 
    If none detected, show all bus instances for user to select 
     If only 1 detected, show only the one.
3) Once user clicks on bus button or submit using selection picker, app will navigate to second screen.

On the second screen: 
4) Bus instance information will be displayed on the UI (Route, Bus Number, Bus Plate
5) App will repeatedly retrieve all bus locations from DB.
